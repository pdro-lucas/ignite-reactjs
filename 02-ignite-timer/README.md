# Ignite Timer - Project Documentation

## About The Project

Ignite Timer is a productivity application designed to help users manage their time effectively while working on various tasks. The application allows users to set a task name and a timer for each task they intend to work on. With a sleek countdown feature on the main page and a comprehensive report page, users can track their activities, monitor progress, and view the status of each taskâ€”whether it's interrupted, in progress, or completed.
