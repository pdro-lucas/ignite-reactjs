# Ignite Feed - Static Social Media Platform

## About The Project

Ignite Feed is a simulated social media blogging platform designed for educational purposes. It mimics the core functionalities of a blog where users can post content and engage with others through comments. As a static page, the interactions are not persistent, meaning any comments or likes will be reset upon page refresh. This project is ideal for understanding the basics of user interfaces and state management in React applications.

## Features

- **Static Posts**: Display posts from a predefined array mimicking a database.
- **Engagement**: Allows users to 'like' and comment on posts.
- **Interactivity**: Users can delete comments within the session.
- **Non-Persistent Data**: Interactions do not persist between page loads.

## Data Structure

The project uses a predefined data array with a specific structure for posts:

```javascript
const posts = [
  {
    id: 1,
    author: {
      name: 'Pedro Lucas',
      role: 'Software Engineer',
      avatarUrl: 'https://github.com/pdro-lucas.png',
    },
    content: [
      { type: 'paragraph', content: 'Fala galeraa ðŸ‘‹' },
      {
        type: 'paragraph',
        content: 'Acabei de subir mais um projeto no meu portifa...',
      },
      { type: 'link', content: 'jane.design/doctorcare' },
    ],
    publishedAt: new Date('2023-09-25 20:00:00'),
  },
