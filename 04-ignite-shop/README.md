# Ignite Shop - E-Commerce Simulation with Stripe API Integration

## About The Project

Ignite Shop is a demonstration e-commerce application with the primary goal of integrating with the Stripe API. It's a storefront that specializes in showcasing a carousel of shirt products. Users can browse through the selection and, upon clicking a product, are taken to a detailed page where they can proceed to purchase via Stripe's checkout service. The application's checkout process is designed to simulate a real shopping experience, concluding with a success page that displays the details of the fictitious purchase.
